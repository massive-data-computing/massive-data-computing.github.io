### Upcoming lab meetings

Every Friday at 13:30 EST, we get together (mix of virtual and in person) for lab presentations (with food! sometimes).
On a rotating basis, each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know or shares their work. 
Anything, really. Relevant and interesting topics, good skills to know, nice Python packages,
neuroscientific princples, new findings and literature reviews... anything!
